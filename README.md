# PYTHON-CSE-PROJECT
This project is a basic Expense Manager application created using Python. It helps users keep track of their daily expenses like food, travel, shopping, etc. The program allows users to enter details such as description, amount, date, category, day, week, and month. All the expenses are stored and can be viewed whenever needed.
The main goal of this project is to learn how to handle user input, store data, and display it properly using Python. It works through a menu system where the user can:
Add a new expense
View all the expenses
Exit the program
This project helped me practice important Python concepts like loops, lists, functions, and input validation. In the future, it can be improved by saving expenses in a file or adding a graphical interface to make it look better.
